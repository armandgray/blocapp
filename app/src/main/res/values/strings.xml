    <string name="whoarewe_text">At its foundation, BLOC represents the formation of a community! In particular, the BLOC community is designed to be a locus for the support and promotion of the Black men at Pomona College. This community is active at Pomona College and is maintained by its members. These members include any and all men on campus actively in support of the unity, strength and voice of the marginalized men at the 5 C’s. The core values of the group have four direct points of impact: Social Unity, On-Campus Activism, Off-Campus Community Organization, and Academic Promotion. The first aspect of Social Unity represents the formation of the community through the induction of new members, the interactions at meetings, communication with alumni and presentation of BLOC produced events. On-Campus Activism reflects the ideology of the members of the organization in standing behind one another and behind the community of color at Pomona. Off-Campus Community Organization has been on going through collaborations with local high schools in the area and the specific community programs initiated by BLOC members. The last most important aspect of the core values, Academic Promotion, represents an emerging focus on the educational support and professional development of BLOC’s own members.These four points of emphasis focus the BLOC community towards a specific and achievable goal.</string>
    <string name="mission_text">BLOC is a crucial resource for self-identified marginalized—but in no way marginal—students. BLOC is a supportive extended family at the sometimes-alienating Claremont Colleges. BLOC is a tight-knit brotherhood; let this be most sacred. BLOC promotes academic achievement and celebrates members’ successes. The organization recognizes, takes on, and tries to mitigate hardship as exercises in collective compassion.\n\nBLOC members hone skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. Leadership opportunities prepare members for success in their chosen careers and, more importantly, as human beings. BLOC creates well-rounded programs and strives for excellence and quality in all its undertakings. Members, both individually and collectively, work toward the advancement of the campus community and broader communities. In doing so, BLOC contributes to the betterment of each member.\n\nBLOC harnesses its tight-knit brotherhood to collaborate with other people, groups, and communities. BLOC hopes to assess the local climate in order to gauge the needs of the underrepresented. BLOC fosters close partnerships within the 5C community to achieve common goals. By embarking on these endeavors together, BLOC seeks mediation, reconciliation, and understanding. Co-curricular activities can be as valuable as the classroom experience; hence, BLOC promotes involvement in all aspects of collegiate life.</string>
